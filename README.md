Spoiler Extension is a chrome extension that helps movie enthusiasts by detecting and blacking out spoilers of their favourite movies. 
It gives users a facility to mention the names of the movies, spoilers of which they don't wish to see.

We use JS , jQuery , jSon . HTML and CSS to implement the code.
